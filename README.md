# TransportKit

## Supported Cities

* Munich
* Berlin
* London
* New York City
* Nuremberg
* Regensburg
* Salzburg

## Example Page

You can have a look at the styles here: [schaechinger.com/transportkit](https://www.schaechinger.com/transportkit).

## Build CSS

First clone the repository to your machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/schaechinger/transportkit.git
cd transportkit
```

The SASS are located in the `sass` folder, separated in transport types.

To build the project run:

```sh
npm i
npm run build
```

## Use CSS

The current versions in CSS format are located in the `styles` folder after the build. \
Each supported city has it's own file if you only want to use styles for one city.
If you cloned the repository and edited the SASS files make sure you build the project first.

### Download CSS

However, if you want to use the CSS files right without compiling, you can refer to these links to get the styles for all cities or insert the lower case city name into the second link:
