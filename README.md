# TransportKit

## Example Page

You can have a look at the styles here: [schaechinger.com/transportkit](https://www.schaechinger.com/tansportkit).

## Use CSS

The current versions in CSS format are located in the `styles` folder. \
Each supported city has it's own file if you only want to use styles for one city.
If you cloned the repository and edited the SASS files make sure you build the project first.

## Build Manually

First clone the repository to your machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/schaechinger/transportkit.git
cd transportkit
```

The SASS are located in the `sass` folder, separated in transport types.

To build the project run:

```sh
npm i
npm run build
```
